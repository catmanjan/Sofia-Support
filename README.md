SOFIA library for Android development. 

Seems it was used as part of a learning tool for some University courses, I found some open source projects that used it but the Sofia library itself was nowhere to be found.

If you find a similar project just include this library and it should work, you may have to do some fiddling as there were a few versions released but no version tracking.
